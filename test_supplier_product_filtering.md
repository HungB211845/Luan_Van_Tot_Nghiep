# Test Plan: Supplier Product Filtering Fix

## üêõ ISSUE FIXED:
**Problem**: When selecting products for Purchase Order after choosing a supplier, the screen was showing ALL products from ALL suppliers instead of only products from the selected supplier.

## üîß ROOT CAUSE:
- `BulkProductSelectionScreen` was calling `loadProducts()` which loads ALL products
- `_getFilteredProducts()` method only filtered by search query and category, NOT by supplier/company
- Client-side filtering by `companyId` was missing

## ‚úÖ FIXES IMPLEMENTED:

### 1. **Added ProductProvider.loadProductsByCompany() Method**
- **File**: `lib/features/products/providers/product_provider.dart`
- **Purpose**: Load products filtered by specific company/supplier at server-side
- **Usage**: `loadProductsByCompany(companyId, category: optional)`

### 2. **Updated BulkProductSelectionScreen.initState()**
- **File**: `lib/features/products/screens/purchase_order/bulk_product_selection_screen.dart`
- **Changed**: `loadProducts()` ‚Üí `loadProductsByCompany(widget.supplierId)`
- **Result**: Now only loads products from selected supplier

### 3. **Enhanced Category Filtering**
- **Method**: `_onCategoryChanged()`
- **Enhancement**: Now calls `loadProductsByCompany()` with both supplier and category filters
- **Result**: Server-side filtering for both company and category

### 4. **Simplified Client-Side Filtering**
- **Method**: `_getFilteredProducts()`
- **Optimization**: Removed redundant company and category filtering since they're done server-side
- **Result**: Only search query filtering remains on client-side

## üß™ TESTING STEPS:

### **Pre-Test Setup:**
1. Ensure database has:
   - Multiple suppliers/companies (Company A, Company B)
   - Products assigned to different companies via `company_id`
   - Example:
     - Product 1: "Ph√¢n NPK" ‚Üí Company A
     - Product 2: "Thu·ªëc tr·ª´ s√¢u" ‚Üí Company B
     - Product 3: "L√∫a gi·ªëng ST5" ‚Üí Company A

### **Test Scenario 1: Basic Supplier Filtering**
1. **Navigate**: Main Menu ‚Üí Purchase Orders ‚Üí Create New PO
2. **Action**: Select "Company A" as supplier
3. **Action**: Tap "Select Products" to open BulkProductSelectionScreen
4. **Expected**: Only show products from Company A (Product 1 + Product 3)
5. **Expected**: Should NOT show Product 2 (belongs to Company B)

### **Test Scenario 2: Category + Supplier Filtering**
1. **Navigate**: Same as above, select Company A
2. **Action**: In product selection screen, filter by "Fertilizer" category
3. **Expected**: Only show Company A products that are Fertilizers
4. **Expected**: Should NOT show seeds or pesticides from Company A

### **Test Scenario 3: Search + Supplier Filtering**
1. **Navigate**: Same as above, select Company A
2. **Action**: Search for "NPK" in search bar
3. **Expected**: Only show Company A products matching "NPK"
4. **Expected**: Should NOT show Company B products even if they match "NPK"

### **Test Scenario 4: Different Supplier Selection**
1. **Navigate**: Create new PO
2. **Action**: Select "Company B" as supplier
3. **Action**: Open product selection
4. **Expected**: Only show Company B products (Product 2)
5. **Expected**: Should NOT show Company A products

## üéØ VERIFICATION POINTS:

- [ ] **Server-side filtering works**: `loadProductsByCompany()` only returns products with matching `company_id`
- [ ] **Client-side filtering simplified**: No redundant filtering in `_getFilteredProducts()`
- [ ] **Category filtering enhanced**: Works together with supplier filtering
- [ ] **Search functionality preserved**: Search only works within supplier's products
- [ ] **Performance improved**: Fewer products loaded from database
- [ ] **UI consistency**: Product count and "No products" messages are accurate

## üìä EXPECTED PERFORMANCE IMPROVEMENT:
- **Before**: Load ALL products ‚Üí Filter client-side (inefficient)
- **After**: Load ONLY supplier products ‚Üí Minimal client-side filtering (efficient)
- **Result**: Faster loading, less memory usage, more accurate results

## üö® POTENTIAL EDGE CASES TO TEST:
1. **Supplier with no products**: Should show "No products available" message
2. **Supplier with products but no matches for search**: Should show "No search results"
3. **Category filter with no matching products**: Should show empty list
4. **Network/database errors**: Should show appropriate error messages

**Fix ensures that Purchase Order product selection is now supplier-specific and efficient!** üöÄ
