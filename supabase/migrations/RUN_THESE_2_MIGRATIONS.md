# üöÄ CH·∫†Y 2 MIGRATIONS SAU KHI RESTART SUPABASE

## ‚úÖ Prerequisites Done:
- ‚úÖ Supabase project ƒë√£ restart
- ‚úÖ PostgREST schema cache ƒë√£ clear
- ‚úÖ Compile errors ƒë√£ fix

---

## üìã MIGRATION SEQUENCE - CH·∫†Y ƒê√öNG TH·ª® T·ª∞

### **MIGRATION 1: Fix Function & Views** (RUN THIS FIRST)
**File:** `20251005150000_final_price_sync_fix.sql`

**What it does:**
- Drops old function with wrong signature (4 params)
- Creates new function with correct signature (3 params matching client code)
- Recreates views `expiring_batches` and `low_stock_products` with correct schema
- Adds performance indexes

**How to run:**
1. Open Supabase SQL Editor
2. Copy **ENTIRE CONTENT** of `20251005150000_final_price_sync_fix.sql`
3. Paste into SQL Editor
4. Click **RUN**

**Expected Output:**
```
‚úÖ update_product_selling_price function created with correct signature
‚úÖ expiring_batches view created
‚úÖ low_stock_products view created
‚úÖ Price history index created

status: ‚úÖ Final Price Sync Fix Completed
```

---

### **MIGRATION 2: Sync Prices from History** (RUN THIS SECOND)
**File:** `20251005140000_manual_price_sync_from_history.sql`

**What it does:**
- Updates ALL active products with their latest price from `price_history`
- Ensures `products.current_selling_price` matches latest price history entry

**How to run:**
1. Open Supabase SQL Editor
2. Copy **ENTIRE CONTENT** of `20251005140000_manual_price_sync_from_history.sql`
3. Paste into SQL Editor
4. Click **RUN**

**Expected Output:**
```
NOTICE: === PRICE SYNC SUMMARY ===
NOTICE: Total active products: X
NOTICE: Products synced with price history: Y
NOTICE: Products with zero price (after sync): 0
NOTICE: ‚úÖ All products with price history have been synced successfully
```

**‚ö†Ô∏è If you see "Products with zero price (after sync): N" where N > 0:**
This means some products have price history but sync failed. Check logs for details.

---

## üîç VERIFICATION AFTER MIGRATIONS

**Run this query to verify prices synced correctly:**
```sql
SELECT
    p.id,
    p.name,
    p.current_selling_price as product_table_price,
    (
        SELECT new_price
        FROM price_history
        WHERE product_id = p.id
        ORDER BY changed_at DESC
        LIMIT 1
    ) as latest_history_price,
    CASE
        WHEN p.current_selling_price = (
            SELECT new_price
            FROM price_history
            WHERE product_id = p.id
            ORDER BY changed_at DESC
            LIMIT 1
        ) THEN '‚úÖ SYNCED'
        ELSE '‚ùå MISMATCH'
    END as sync_status
FROM public.products p
WHERE p.is_active = true
  AND p.id IN (SELECT product_id FROM price_history)
ORDER BY sync_status DESC, p.name
LIMIT 20;
```

**Expected:** All rows should show `‚úÖ SYNCED`

## üö¶ NEXT STEPS AFTER MIGRATIONS

### **Step 1: Full Restart Flutter App**
```bash
# In terminal where flutter run is running:
# Press 'q' to quit
# Then run:
flutter run -d <device-id>

# OR press 'R' (uppercase) for full restart
```

### **Step 2: Check Logs - Should NOT See:**
- ‚ùå "view not available"
- ‚ùå "column available_stock does not exist"
- ‚ùå "connection timeout 503"
- ‚ùå "function signature mismatch"

### **Step 3: Check Logs - Should See:**
- ‚úÖ "Generating route for: /home" (no errors after)
- ‚úÖ Products loading successfully
- ‚úÖ No view errors

### **Step 4: Test POS Screen**
1. Navigate to POS Screen
2. Search for a product
3. **Expected:** Price displays correctly (e.g., "200,000 VND" NOT "0 VND")
4. Add product to cart
5. **Expected:** Price in cart matches product price

### **Step 5: Test Product Detail Screen**
1. Navigate to any product
2. **Expected:** Screen loads immediately (no infinite loading)
3. **Expected:** "Gi√° B√°n Hi·ªán T·∫°i" shows correct price
4. Check "L·ªãch S·ª≠ Thay ƒê·ªïi Gi√°" tab
5. **Expected:** Price history loads successfully

### **Step 6: Test Price Update Flow**
1. In Product Detail Screen, tap on current price to edit
2. Enter new price (e.g., 250000)
3. Tap "Xong" to save
4. **Expected:** Toast "C·∫≠p nh·∫≠t gi√° b√°n th√†nh c√¥ng"
5. Go back to POS Screen
6. Search for same product
7. **Expected:** Price updated to 250,000 VND

---

## ‚úÖ SUCCESS CRITERIA

After completing ALL steps:

- ‚úÖ No view errors in Flutter logs
- ‚úÖ No connection timeout errors
- ‚úÖ POS Screen shows prices correctly (NOT 0 VND)
- ‚úÖ Product Detail Screen loads immediately
- ‚úÖ Can update price from Product Detail
- ‚úÖ Updated price appears in POS Screen instantly

---

## üö® IF STILL NOT WORKING

**Problem: Still seeing view errors**
- Run `FORCE_SCHEMA_RELOAD.sql` again
- Check output - view should exist with `current_stock` column

**Problem: Prices still 0 VND**
- Verify migration 2 ran successfully
- Check verification query above
- Ensure price_history table has valid entries

**Problem: Function signature error**
- Re-run migration 1
- Verify function signature matches: `(product_id uuid, new_price numeric, reason text)`

---

## üìû REPORT BACK

After running both migrations, send me:
1. ‚úÖ Screenshot of migration 1 output
2. ‚úÖ Screenshot of migration 2 output (with product counts)
3. ‚úÖ Screenshot of verification query results
4. ‚úÖ Flutter logs after app restart (last 30 lines)
5. ‚úÖ Screenshot of POS Screen showing prices

Tao s·∫Ω verify everything ƒë√£ ho·∫°t ƒë·ªông ƒë√∫ng!
